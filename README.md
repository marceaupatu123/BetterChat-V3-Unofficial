# BetterChat V3 (Unofficial Repo)
This github project is an unofficial project created to allow Jumpathy's project to continue despite the fact that he decided to stop its development.
Note that in the presentation of the project, the "I" is used to designate @Jumpathy and not @Dominus_Marceau, if you want a more detailed presentation of the project I invite you to look directly at the [original post](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/better-chat-v3-feature-rich-custom-chat-with-replies-rich-text-message-editing-and-more/1756348).

## What is BetterChat ?

Socialization is an integral aspect of most games, so I strived to make a custom chat system that could help users better interact with each other and convey their messages more effectively. This project took me over five months of off-and-on work to complete, and I sincerely hope this can help others.
